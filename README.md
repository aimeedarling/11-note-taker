# 11-note-taker

## Description
This is a simple note taking app. With it you can save notes and delete them. In this is a project I was given the front end code and my challenge was to write the code for the back end, connect the and deploy the app to Heroku. This project shows my new skill of working with Express.js and Heroku.
